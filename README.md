## M5_Forecasting
This project details the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  on the M5 data (https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy) in data_analysis.ipynb. 
In addition, we build a machine learning model to provide one-step (step_forecast.ipynb) and 
multi-step (multistep_forecast.ipynb) forecasts on several product categories in the M5 data.
